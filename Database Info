Database for the irc channel is called irc.
Users are stored in a table named users.
No users for the database set up yet. I will implement encryption for the passwords at some indeterminate point in the future.

Most, if not all, of the test accounts have 'test' as the password.

The user Campbell is subscribed to the 'General' room. So is the user Jordan.
